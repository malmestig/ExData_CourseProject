## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

## First, reduce the dimension of the SCC dataframe by first grep-ing for all rows related to "coal" or "lignite" in the SCC.Level.Three variable. 
## then further narrow that down to only involve combustion by grep-ing for "combustion" in the SCC.Level.One variable 
coal.all <- SCC[grep("coal|lignite", SCC$SCC.Level.Three, ignore.case = TRUE),]
coal.combustion <- coal.all[grep("combustion", coal.all$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case = TRUE),]

## Only the rows that have an SCC in coal combustion 
NEI.coal.combustion <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% coal.combustion$SCC,]

## aggregate the sum per year
emissions <- aggregate(NEI.coal.combustion$Emissions, by=list(NEI.coal.combustion$year), sum)
colnames(emissions) <- c("year","emissions.sum")
