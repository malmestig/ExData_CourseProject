## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!

## subset to just Baltimore City

## The specification simply says motor vehicles without any distinction so I assume that grep-ing for "vehicle" will be a motor vehicle.

# Only the measurements that have an SCC in vehicles
BC.vehicles <- BC[BC$SCC %in% vehicles.all$SCC,]

## aggregate the sum per year
emissions <- aggregate(BC.vehicles$Emissions, by=list(BC.vehicles$year), sum)
